# Takeaway Challenge
We were tasked with creating a takeaway app that used `RSpec` as a testing suite. The app had to be developed in `Ruby`, and make use of the `Twilio API`. It had to send alerts when a user placed an order, with an expected delivery time of one hour from now.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
